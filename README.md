This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript that arises when passing an argument of an incorrect type to a function. The `add` function expects two numbers as arguments, but the code calls it with a number and a string. This leads to a type error during compilation.  The solution involves ensuring that all arguments passed to the function are of the correct type, either through explicit type checking or type guards.
